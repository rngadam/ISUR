Probably a Karting racetrack such as:

http://www.kartingasia.com/kart_tracks/shanghai-f1-kart-world-t233.html
http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/listings/sports/go_karting/has/disc-kart-indoor-karting/

== Final rankings ==

Based on the sum of all points accumulated in each of the stages.

If there is a tie in the overall ranking, the ranking of the most advanced stage achieved will be used as a tie-breaker.

Example:

- Team #1 and team #2 are tied for first place with 12 points each.  
- They've both completed the last stage with Team #2 finishing first while Team #1 finished second.  
- Team #2 would then be declared first place overall and Team #1 second place overall.

== Ordering ==

Time slots or choices are given in each stage in the order of the ranking in the previous stage.

Example: 1st place in stage 1 gets 1st choice of time slot in stage 2.
